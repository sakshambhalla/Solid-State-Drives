# Solid-State-Drives

An SSD (solid-state drive) is a type of nonvolatile storage media that stores persistent data on solid-state flash memory. Two key components make up an SSD: a flash controller and NAND flash memory chips. The architectural configuration of the SSD controller is optimized to deliver high read and write performance for both sequential and random data requests. SSDs are sometimes referred to as flash drives or solid-state disks.





The HDD mechanism and hard disk are packaged as an integrated unit. Businesses and computer manufacturers have used spinning disk historically, owing to their lower unit cost and higher average durability, although SSDs are now common in desktop and laptop PCs.
